# Skeleton

## On development stage!

**The PHP backend includes a wrapper for web applications based on the 'front controller', 'data mapper', and other patterns.
The frontend build based on Smarty class or React app to choose from.**

##### The "public" folder should contain a symbolic link to "index.php" from the "backend" folder.

The files in the public folder are automatically copied when building the React application.
For the Smarty class based frontend to work, apart from a symbolic link to index.php and static files, nothing is required.
